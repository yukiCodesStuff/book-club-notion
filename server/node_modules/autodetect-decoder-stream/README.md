# autodetect-decoder-stream

[![npm Version](https://badge.fury.io/js/autodetect-decoder-stream.png)](https://npmjs.org/package/autodetect-decoder-stream)

An `iconv-lite` stream that autodetects the encoding and fallbacks to a specified fallback encoding.


Usage example:

```javascript
const AutoDetectDecoderStream = require('autodetect-decoder-stream');

let stream = fs.createReadStream('1.csv').pipe(new AutoDetectDecoderStream({ defaultEncoding: '1255' }));

stream
    .on('data', data => {
      console.log(data);
    })
    .on('end', () => {
      console.log('Done reading.');
    });

```

Other options that could be passed:

Option | Explanation | Default
---- | ------------ | ------
  `defaultEncoding` | The fallback encoding, if nothing was detected. If "ASCII" is found, it also assumes that there was not enough data to go on, and falls back. | `'utf8'`
  `minConfidence` | Minimum confidence to require for detecting encodings. See [jschardet](https://github.com/aadsm/jschardet) | Depends on `jschardet` (Currently 0.2)
  `consumeSize` | How much data to use for detecting the encoding? - in bytes. | `128` bytes
  `stripBOM` | Should strip the BOM for UTF streams? | `true`
